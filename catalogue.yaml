            Replica of the Climate extreme indices and heat stress indicators derived from CMIP6 global climate projections dataset (CICERO_ETCCDI) from the Copernicus Climate Datastore on gadi. This collection is a copy of CICERO_ETCCDI, which includes climate indices calculated on CMIP6 models historical and projections experiments. The collection includes ETCCDI (climate extrems indices) at yearly and monthly resolution, and HSI (Heat Stress Indicators) at daily resolution.
            This dataset is part of the Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection at NCI.
            The files were downloaded from the CDS as netcdf files and compressed using nccopy.

            It contains records from over 100,000 stations in 180 countries and territories. The period of record station files are parsed into yearly csv files that contain all available GHCN Daily station data for that year plus a time of observation field (where available).

            This data set is for the bias-corrected, reprocessed CPC Morphing technique (CMORPH) high-resolution global satellite precipitation estimates. 
            The bias corrected CMORPH satellite precipitation estimates are created on an 8 km by 8 km grid over the global domain from 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N and in a 30-minute interval from January 1998 to present. Due to the delay of some input data sets, this formal version (Version 1) bias corrected CMORPH is produced manually once a month at a latency of 3-4 months.

            Replica of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) global precipitation estimate. IMERG is the continuation of TRMM. The latest version is the minor version 06B which combines the precipitation estimates collected by the TRMM satellite (2000 - 2015) with the estimates from the GPM satellite (2014 - present).
            The monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean and tropical land is used to correct known biases.
            The dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) over the globe and a temporal resolution of 30 minutes. The temporal coverage starts on 2000-06-01 to  present with about 3 months of delay. The netcdf version we provide here is updated irregularly, so the delay is effectively up to a year.
            NB These files have a Julian calendar, use to_dataset_dict(cdf_kwargs={'decode_times':False}) to avoid errors opening the files. Also be aware that the size of this dataset is quite big, if trying to get a a timeseries on a point or region use the preprocessing argument as shown in the demo.
